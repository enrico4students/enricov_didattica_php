/* Escape Character
To insert characters that are illegal in a string, use an escape character.

An escape character is a backslash \ followed by the character you want to insert.

An example of an illegal character is a double quote inside a string that is surrounded by double quotes:

Example
*/
// $x = "We are the so-called "Vikings" from the north.";

// To fix this problem, use the escape character \":
$x = "We are the so-called \"Vikings\" from the north.";

$myvar = substr("Hello world",6);;
$x = " \$myvar"; 
echo $x;
